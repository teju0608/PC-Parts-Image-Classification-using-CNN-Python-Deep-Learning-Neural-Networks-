# PC-Parts-Image-Classification-using-CNN-Python-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-

Developed a CNN model to classify images of PC Parts into categories such as CPU, GPU, RAM, 
MOTHERBOARD etc.
Preprocessed the image dataset, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, using 
TensorFlow and Keras.
Designed and implemented CNN architecture consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, 
and fully connected layers to learn features from PC parts images.
Trained the CNN model on labeled dataset containing thousands of images, achieving 
classification accuracy of over 93%.
